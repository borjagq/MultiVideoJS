MultiVideoJS is a plugin for jQuery that creates a video player in your site. It allows multiple videos to behave as one single video in a player, without actually having to join and process them. It also allows to select fragments of videos (or even fragments of the same video). It supports HTML5 video and modern streaming formats, as well as YouTube. The core of MultiVideoJS works with video.js, youtube.js and YouTube's video API.
