# MultiVideoJS

DISCLAIMER: This project hasn't been updated nor checked since 2016. It has been recently republished due to an account change.

MultiVideoJS is a plugin for jQuery that creates a video player in your site. It allows multiple videos to behave as one single video in a player, without actually having to join and process them. It also allows to select fragments of videos (or even fragments of the same video). It supports HTML5 video and modern streaming formats, as well as YouTube. The core of MultiVideoJS works with video.js, youtube.js and YouTube's video API.

## Getting started üöÄ

Follow these instructions to use MultiVideoJS on your project.


### Pre-requisites üìã

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development and production machines:

* jQuery - [Download jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/). Of course, being a jQuery plugin, MultiVideoJS needs jQuery to work.
* Video.js - [Download Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js). MultiVideoJS requires the video.js player.
* Youtube.js - [Download Youtube.js](https://videojs.com/plugins). MultiVideoJS requires the Video.js's Youtube.js player.

### Installation üîß

Include MultiVideoJS's .js and .css files on your page, after its requirements:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="MultiVideo.css">
<script src="MultiVideo.js"></script>
```


### Initialization üì¶

The MultiVideoJS needs to be initiated when the target DOM element is ready. The safest bet is to start it on window `onload` event or jQuery's document.ready, but it can also be launched on a script tag positioned below the element.

To sum up, the smallest MultiVideoJS configuration is:

```html
<head>
...
</head>
<body>
	<div id="myDiv"></div>
	<script>
		var myP = $('#myDiv').MultiVideoJS({
			sources: [
				{
					type: "video/youtube",
					src: "https://youtu.be/E9jrQSpMxes",
					ini: 200,
					end: 210
				}, {
					type: "video/youtube",
					src: "https://youtu.be/YPWcs2odleA",
					ini: 60,
					end: 70
				}
			],
			poster: 'url("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1429277096327-11ee3b761c93?crop=entropy&dpr=2&fit=crop&fm=jpg&h=800&ixjsv=2.1.0&ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=50&w=1350")',
			width: 800
		});
	</script>
</body>
```


## Configuring the MultiVideoJS ‚öôÔ∏è

MultiVideoJS can be configured by passing an object of option - value pairs during the initialization phase.

```js
var myP = $('#myDiv').MultiVideoJS({
	sources: [
		{
			type: "video/youtube",
			src: "https://youtu.be/E9jrQSpMxes",
			ini: 200,
			end: 210
		}, {
			type: "video/youtube",
			src: "https://youtu.be/YPWcs2odleA",
			ini: 60,
			end: 70
		}
	],
	poster: 'url("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1429277096327-11ee3b761c93?crop=entropy&dpr=2&fit=crop&fm=jpg&h=800&ixjsv=2.1.0&ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=50&w=1350")',
	width: 800
});
```

Settings can also be changed or first set by passing the option key and the value as two parameters.

```js
$('#myDiv').MultiVideoJS('width', 800);
```


## Docs üìñ

In this section you can read about the options, events and methods of this plugin.

### Options

#### **options.poster: `string`**

Path to the image that will appear onscreen before and after the sequence of videos have been played.

default: `null`

#### **options.sources: `array of objects` (required)**

Each object in the array represents a source and contains:

* src `string` (required): path to the video or youtube url.
* type `string` (required): media type (‚Äòvideo/mp4‚Äô, ‚Äòvideo/youtube‚Äô, ‚Ä¶)
* ini `number`: start position in seconds.
* end `number`: end position in seconds.

#### **options.fixedControls: `bool`**

If true, the video controls are displayed in a fixed position under the player, else, they‚Äôre displayed inside the video box when the mouse moves.

default: `false`

#### **options.autoplay: `bool`**

If true, the video reproduction starts when the player is ready.

default: `false`

#### **options.width: 'string / number'**

If both are specified, both will be respected.
If only one is specified, the other value will be computed to respect 16:9 aspect ratio.
Otherwise, the default values will be applied.

default: `800px`

#### **options.height: 'string / number'**

If both are specified, both will be respected.
If only one is specified, the other value will be computed to respect 16:9 aspect ratio.
Otherwise, the default values will be applied.

default: `450px`

#### **options.extraControls: `array of objects`**

Each object in the array represents a custom button with its action and contains:

* callback `function` (required): callback function that will be executed when button is clicked.
* id `string`: Id attribute of the HTML element.
* class `string`: Class attribute of the HTML element.

default: `null`


### Custom events

MultiVideoJS emits some custom events you can hook to.

To register them you use the `on(type, fn)` method.

```js
var myDiv = $('#myDiv').MultiVideoJS({...});

myDiv.on('refreshed', doSomething);
```

The available events are:

* **ready**: This event is triggered when the player is ready for reproduction.
* **ended**: This event is triggered when the last video in the sources finishes its reproduction
* **nextVideo**: This event is triggered when any video in the sources but the last finishes its reproduction and the following video starts its own.
* **playing**: This event gets triggered while the video is playing.
